# TicTacToe2D

#Ruby 2.6.2 :: Ruby2D 0.9.5 :: RSpec 3.10

Unfinished but working proof of concept.

TicTacToe2D was created as an assignment for TheOdinProject. it uses Ruby2d to create
a 2D window, allowing players to visualize the game(of course). The only game that
that should be played in ASCII is Dwarf Fortress and Caves of Quid, lets keep it that way.
